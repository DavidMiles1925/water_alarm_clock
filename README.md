### About the Product

This is a project in development to create an alarm clock that will spray you with water to help heavy sleepers get out of bed in the morning.

### Inspiration

This idea was ceonceived by Jonathan Hoffman, who has always thought outside of the box. He is a heavy sleeper, and wants something to get him moving quickly in the moring.
